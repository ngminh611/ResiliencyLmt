    <p > RTT & PSYCH-K® are both spectacular modalities in which we can easily access & realign the subconscious. 
        </p>
       <p>They are both very different in application RTT is 100% mind based, in addition PSYCH-K® utilises the the innate intelligence of the body, given the body is the subconscious in action we are able to get very clear responses in order to know what is & isn’t believed on a subconscious level.
           </p>
       <p>Combining the power of these 2 methods supercharges our ability to transform & enjoy the positive change & freedom we seek.</p>
       <p>

RTT & PSYCH-K® along with Sally’s own Signature Processes that she’s finely tuned & continues to build on as she discovers new ways to facilitate freedom, all come together seamlessly in every bespoke session based on what is need by the individual.</p>
